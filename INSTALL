Please note that LORAAX is currently in a pre-release stage, so if you want to
try it, you will have to compile it and install its dependencies yourself. When
the initial release is ready, binaries for Windows and Linux will be provided.

For now, a Makefile is provided to build LORAAX. You will need a C++ compiler
(by default g++, the GNU compiler). Before you can build libxfoil, you will
first need to install:

eigen (linear algebra library): http://eigen.tuxfamily.org
tinyxml2 (XML parser): http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2
libxfoil (Xfoil library): https://github.com/montagdude/libxfoil

Once these are installed, you can just type `make` from the build directory to
compile LORAAX (this assumes you also have make on your system). You may need
to edit the CXX variable in the Makefile to point to the C++ compiler installed
on your system and the INCLUDE variable depending on where the header files for
the dependencies listed above are located.

To run LORAAX, first set up an input XML or try one of the provided sample
cases. Then type the command:

loraax -i input.xml

substituting the actual name of the XML file for input.xml.
