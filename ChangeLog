        version 0.1.1
        * Fix a bug in induced drag calcuation (would still give the right
          answer for some compilers; bug invoked undefined behavior).
        * Remove as many shared library dependencies from Linux build as
          possible; should work nearly everywhere now.
        * Add 32-bit Linux build.
