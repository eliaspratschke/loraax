<!-- Freestream reference conditions. Freestream speed must be given in units of
     length/sec, where length is the length unit inherent in your aircraft
     geometry. In other words, if your geometry file has units of inches, the
     freestream speed should be given in inches/sec, NOT mph. The density and
     viscosity units must also be consistent with this definition. If you don't
     use consistent units, the computed Reynolds number will be wrong, and the
     time step you choose may not be appropriate for the freestream speed. For
     convenience, here are values of density and viscosity at sea level in some
     common unit systems:

     meters / kilograms / seconds:
       density = 1.225
       viscosity = 1.81e-05

     inches / snails / seconds:
       density = 
       viscosity = 

     feet / slugs / seconds:
       density = 
       viscosity =

<!-- The distance behind a wing over which the wake will convect with the

     over a distance of 1000 * RollupDist. (So make sure RollupDist is long
     enough!) -->

<!-- Initial wake angle for the convecting part of the wake (within RollupDist).
     Defaults to angle of attack, but sometimes that may result in an unstable
     solution for higher angles of attack. The wake rollup procedure will take
     care of placing the wake properly by the end of the simulation regardless
     of this value. -->
