<!-- Freestream reference conditions. Freestream speed must be given in units of
     length/sec, where length is the length unit inherent in your aircraft
     geometry. In other words, if your geometry file has units of inches, the
     freestream speed should be given in inches/sec, NOT mph. The density,
     pressure, and viscosity units must also be consistent with this definition.
     If you don't use consistent units, the computed Reynolds number will be
     wrong, and dimensional forces and moments will be wrong. For convenience,
     here are values of density, viscosity, and pressure at sea level on a
     standard day in some common unit systems:

     meters / kilograms / seconds:
       density = 1.2252
       viscosity = 1.7894e-05
       pressure = 101325

     inches / snails / seconds:
       density = 1.1465e-07
       viscosity = 2.5953e-09
       pressure = 14.6959

     feet / slugs / seconds:
       density = 2.3773e-03
       viscosity = 3.7372e-07
       pressure = 2116.22

<!-- The distance behind a wing over which the wake will convect with the
     local flow velocity. Behind this, the wake is aligned with the freestream
     over a distance of 1000 * RollupDist. (So make sure RollupDist is long
     enough!) -->

<!-- Number of streamwise divisions in the rolling-up portion of the wake. Also
     defines the time step: dt = RollupDist / (FreestreamSpeed * WakeSteps) -->
  <WakeSteps>50</WakeSteps>

<!-- Initial wake angle for the convecting part of the wake (within RollupDist).
     Defaults to angle of attack, but sometimes that may result in an unstable
     solution for higher angles of attack. The wake rollup procedure will take
     care of placing the wake properly by the end of the simulation regardless
     of this value. -->
